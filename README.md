GitHub API client for Rust, supporting `hyper` and `reqwest` (async and blocking).

This code is automatically generated from the [OpenAPI spec for the GitHub API](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description).

## Features

The code requires at least one feature to be enabled, to select the HTTP request library:
- `hyper-client` (enabled by default)
- `reqwest-async`
- `reqwest-blocking`

## Contributions

Since this code is automatically generated, Pull Requests will not be accepted directly.

If you find a problem, check if [GitHub's OpenAPI repo](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description) contains the same problem and report there.

If the problem does not exist in the OpenAPI description and appears to be a problem with the code generation, please open an issue in this repo.
